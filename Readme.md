# Periodic Table

This project was complete within 2 hours using React for the frontend and NodeJs for the backend. For styling there is a mix tailwindcss and sass modules.

On the website, you can see the first 54 elements of the periodic table. If you click on an element, you can see the details.

## Run the Project
1. Clone the project

`
git clone
`

2. Install frontend dependencies and run

`
cd frontend
`

`
npm i
`

`
npm run dev
`

3. Open second terminal and prepare the backend

`
cd backend
`

`
npm i
`

`
npm run server
`

## Possible Improvements

1. The responsiveness of table can be better at large and smaller screens. I would need to add calc to the font size in the css.
2. Use NextJs for static rendering for faster page load.
3. Separate Routes and Providers.
